<h1>Machine Learning</h1>


<h3>Description:</h3>

<p>This repository is about the use of machine learning in the daily tasks of our job routine. Just imagine that you and your company are in a complicated situation, the financial is barely breathing, your team need to increase your sales, get new clients and keep the old clients. Well, this algorithm model can save your life and your company life. Notice that we've use a lot of graphics, that's why you really need to understand the meaning of it, you need to see the difference between the axles and the columns.</p>

<h3>How it does work ?</h3>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:18pt;">
		Firstly, the archive who contains the machine learning algorithm it is the 'machine_learnin.pynb', it will read the excel file 'advertising.csv' who contains all the propagation channels investments and the sales of company (monthly); after that it will clean all this data and fix some issues inside the data; when this process had finish, the machine learning libs will use the part of the excel file to teach our algorithm, then the algorithm will use the AI libs to predict the sales. Now the algorithm will compare the 2 AI methods the i used to predict the sales, that one who is closer to 100 will be use as parameter to analyse e take a decision for the company for example.
